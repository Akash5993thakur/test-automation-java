# Test Automation with Java
Web test automation example project using IntelliJ IDEA Community, Java, Maven, TestNG, Selenium 3, Appium and Page Object Model (POM)

## Test Subject
bbc.co.uk

## Libraries and Frameworks
* Selenium 3 - web automation
* Appium - mobile automation
* Maven - build and package management
* TestNG - Test execution and Reporting

## Tools
Using [IntelliJ IDEA Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) version.
I've previously used Eclipse and found it to be a little bit slower and not as intuitive.
You're free to try both and decide for yourself. Also there are a lot of comparison articles out there already. 

## Programming Language
I'm using [Java SE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) version jdk1.8.0_111 and it works very well.
There are a couple of good reasons to use Java:
* It's been around for a while so there are a lot of solutions for most problems and if not then somebody from the community will be able to suggest an answer quickly.
* It's OpenSource - there are large, well supported communities sharing free libraries.
* Because of the above two points it's possible to automate (testing) checking for iOS (Web and Native), Android (Web and Native) and Web platforms.
